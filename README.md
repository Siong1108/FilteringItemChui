Learning App with List and Filtering

Learning chui js

I was just a newbie that learning chui. This function of this simple program was when tap at the list, it will direct to the next screen with no filtering. But when tap at the icon, it will direct to the next screen but with filtering parameter based on the icon. The problem was each time i click on the icon, the function will runnig twice that makes this simple program mess. I have read about the "off" function on the documentation and appplying to the code, but with no result.

Thanks for everyone that help me solved this problem.
